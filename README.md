# Computer Vision Playground
Welcome to CV Playground, a GUI toolkit for writing and testing computer vision algorithms.
The GUI is built with PyQt, the Python bindings for the popular Qt C++ framework.
Programers can add algorithms to the toolkit by implmenting the "Operations" abstract class.
These algorithms will be automatically detected and made avalible in the GUI.
